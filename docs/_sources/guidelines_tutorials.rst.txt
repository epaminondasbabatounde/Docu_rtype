R-Type Tutorial
-------------------

R-Type is a classic shoot'em up (shmup) game where you control a spaceship and battle against formidable enemies and bosses. The game offers two game modes: single-player (player) and multiplayer (multiplayer). In this tutorial, we will guide you through the basics of the game and explain how to play.

1. Installation
------------------

Before you begin playing, make sure you have correctly installed the game by running the provided binaries.

2. Game Modes
---------------

R-Type offers two game modes:

**Single-Player Mode (Player) :**
In this mode, you play solo and face off against enemies on your own. Your goal is to survive waves of enemies, eliminate end-level bosses, and progress through the levels.


**Multiplayer Mode (Multiplayer) :**
In multiplayer mode, you can team up with other players. Here's how it works:

- When you log in, you have the option to create a game section that other players can join.
- Players join your section to form a team.
- Together, you battle enemies and bosses cooperatively to advance in the game.

3. Controls
------------

The game controls are simple:

- Use the arrow keys to move your spaceship up, down, left, and right.
- Press the fire key to shoot projectiles at enemies and bosses. Eliminate them before they hit you.
- Be agile and dodge enemy shots to avoid taking damage. Your health decreases each time you're hit, and if your health bar empties, you'll lose.

4. Objective
-------------

The main objective in R-Type is to progress through levels by eliminating enemies and bosses. At the end of each level, you will face a formidable boss that you must defeat to move on to the next level. In multiplayer mode, teamwork with your team is crucial to defeat bosses.

5. Conclusion
--------------

That's all you need to get started with R-Type. Choose your game mode, master the controls, eliminate enemies and bosses, and advance through the levels. Let the adventure begin!

Have fun, and may the force be with you in the world of R-Type!
