Protocol Documentation for R-Type Game Server and Client
==========================================================

Introduction
------------

Network communication is an essential element of the R-Type server and its associated client's architecture. This protocol documentation explains in detail how this communication functions and provides information on how data is exchanged between the server and clients.

Types of Transmitted Data
---------------------------

In our server-client architecture, various types of data are exchanged, including:

- *Client Commands*: To initiate actions within the game.
- *User Data*: Information specific to each user.
- *System States*: Information about the current state of the game.
- *Server Responses*: Responses to client commands.

Timing and Communication Frequency
------------------------------------

Communication between the server and clients is triggered by different events. Client commands are transmitted instantly, while server state updates are periodically sent.

Encoding and Packet Structure
---------------------------------

Data is exchanged in the form of structured packets, with headers containing information such as packet length and message type. The choice of protocols, data formats, and encoding may vary.

Processing Received Data
-------------------------------

The processing of received data depends on its type, such as client commands, user data, or server state updates.

Communication Schemes
------------------------

Various communication schemes are used, including request-response commands, state updates, event broadcasting, and one-way communication.

Error Handling
--------------------

Error management is crucial to ensure the reliability of network communication. Strategies include handling exceptions, retry mechanisms, error messages, and error detection and handling.

Conclusion
----------

This documentation ensures understanding and reliability in communication between the R-Type game server and its clients, providing a responsive and dependable gaming experience for all players while allowing the server and client to adapt in the event of errors or communication interruptions.
