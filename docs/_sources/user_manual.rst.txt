**For Linux:**

1. **Install Necessary Dependencies:**
   
   To set up and run the project on Linux, you need to install the required dependencies using `Conan`. Open your terminal and execute the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing

2. **Navigate to the Build Directory:**

   After installing the dependencies, navigate to the `build` directory. Use the following command to change your current directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd build

3. **Configure the Project with CMake:**

   Configure the project using CMake by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cmake ..

4. **Build the Project with Make:**

   Build the project using the `make` command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      make

**For Windows:**

1. **Install Necessary Dependencies:**

   To build and run the project on Windows, you should also install the necessary dependencies using `Conan`. Open your command prompt and execute the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing

2. **Navigate to the Build Directory:**

   After installing the dependencies, navigate to the `build` directory using the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd build

3. **Configure the Project with CMake for Visual Studio:**

   Configure the project with CMake, specifying the generator for Visual Studio. Replace `[Visual Studio Version]` with your specific version.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cmake -G "Visual Studio [Visual Studio Version]" -A x64 ..

4. **Build the R_Type Executable:**

   Look for the `R_type.exe` executable and build it.

Once you have completed the platform-specific steps mentioned above, you will have the necessary binaries to run the R-Type project.
