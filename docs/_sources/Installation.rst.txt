===============================================


To get started with R_Type, follow the instructions below based on your platform.

### Linux

On Linux, you can use the following steps to set up and run the project:

1. Install the necessary dependencies using [Conan](https://conan.io/):

   ```bash
   conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing
   ```

2. Navigate to the `build` directory:

   ```bash
   cd build
   ```

3. Configure the project with CMake:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project using `make`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

### Windows

To build and run the project on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies using [Conan](https://conan.io/):

   ```bash
   conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing
   ```

2. Navigate to the `build` directory:

   ```bash
   cd build
   ```

3. Configure the project with CMake, specifying the generator for Visual Studio (replace `[Visual Studio Version]` with your specific version):

   ```bash
   cmake -G "Visual Studio [Visual Studio Version]" ..
   ```

4. Look for the `R_type.exe` executable and build it.

After following the appropriate platform-specific steps, you'll have the necessary binaries to run the project.

## Building the Project

If you ever need to rebuild the project, you can follow the building steps mentioned above for your platform. Make sure to run `cmake` and `make` on Linux and configure the project using the appropriate Visual Studio version on Windows.
